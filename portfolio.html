                    <p>This website is a simple static site hosted using GitHub pages. There are many services that offer free static site hosting. If your website does not require
                        server-side processing this can be a solid option for small businesses and startups.

                        but perhaps with enough effort I could make something enjoyable to play</p>

                    <p>This was my (group) capstone project for graduation, it was built on Node.js with React framework, hosted on Amazon AWS, stored data in a MongoDB table,
                        and used AWS Lambda to query against that table for the business logic.</p>
